## About Project Aurora

> “戒网瘾学校”，即所有针对未成年人的私人监狱的总称。它们以“矫正不良行为”的名义招生，并对受害者进行长期虐待及非法监禁。国内此类机构至少有数千所。
>
> Those schools named as "Internet Quitting School" are personal prisons that target teenagers. They usually enroll students with the announcement claiming "correcting disruptive behaviors" while conducting long-term violence & illegal confinement. There are thousands of this kind of institutions in China at least.

> 至今，关于这个产业（the Troubled Teens Industry），已有了相当多的研究与统计报告，国内外的宣传力量也不断将其曝光在大众视野中。但数十年来，仍没有出现帮助未成年人防范此类迫害的方案。
>
> There are a variaty of research & statistic reports on the Troubled Teens Industry so far. In addition, Chinese & Foreign Medias have revealed it to the public continually. However, there is no solution to help to prevent teens from these persecutions.

> 我们为弥补这一微小的空缺，于2022年2月启动了暮光计划。
>
> To fill the tiny blank, we started the Project Aurora in Feb, 2022.
